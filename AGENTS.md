# Gentle AI — Agent Skills Index

When working on this project, load the relevant skill(s) BEFORE writing any code.

Naming convention: `framework-ai-*` skills are repo-specific workflow skills. Unprefixed skills are portable writing or work-unit skills and intentionally keep their canonical names.

## How to Use

1. Check the trigger column to find skills that match your current task
2. Load the skill by reading the SKILL.md file at the listed path
3. Follow ALL patterns and rules from the loaded skill
4. Multiple skills can apply simultaneously

## Doubts

How do hooks or routing work in opencode and vscode? What exactly is a hook? Give me 3 examples.
Can I create a hook or routing that delegates to a cheaper model during the implementation phase? Can I do this by assigning models to sub-agents, or is a hook a better approach?
Is Codegraph per-project and RTK global? How would global installation work? How does Engram currently work during installation? Is it global, and when running sdd-init does it create a link or a namespace in Engram during global installation? Should Codegraph work the same way?
